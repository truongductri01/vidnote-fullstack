# VidNote

Share your thoughts about a YouTube video just with one click

# The story behind

I used to experience a bad period of mental breakdown when I first arrived at the US for college.

It was really tough during that time.

Then I found a YouTube channel of a Vietnamese soft-skill couch and also found the answers to most of my issues.

The way he presents his idea, the authenticity he express about himself, and also the frankliness in how he shares his thoughts really hit me.

Then I started watching and taking note on almost every videos he posted. That was a lot.

But then I reallize sometimes I do not remember which video was my note taken on. And I also want to share my thoughts on the video with people, especially my family and friends.

So VidNote was born from that.
